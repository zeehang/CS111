Display functionality works. Code for Parts 2 and 3 output to the display.

Note that in this implementation the temperature sensor is connect to pin 0.

Included files:
    display.c and display.h - includes the source code necessary to ouput temperature readings to the display.
        Code logic inspired by publicly available header files from Seeedstudio
    lab4_part1.c - contains source code for program that outputs time and temperature to stdout as well as lab4_1.log 
    lab4_part2.c - contains source code for program that connects to TCP server, sends temperature readings 
        and to the server and adjusts according to commands sent from the server. Also displays the temperature on 
        the Grove LCD
    lab4_part2.c - contains source code that performs the same functionality as part2, but utilizes an SSL connection 
    Makefile - builds all programs and also includes tarball command to generate submission .tar.gz 
    README - this file, describes contents of the tarball 
    display.png - proof that the display functionality works.

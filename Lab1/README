Below, you will find descriptions of the files within this tar

  lab1.c - the source code for the project. I haven't found any limitations
  in the code - it correctly works with the functions listed in the spec. It has been tested against the grading script
  as well as the test cases listed in the Makefile.

  Makefile - has the options to create the tar ball, clean up files created,
  as well as check test cases using testscript.sh. The cases include checking a normal
  rdonly and wronly, as well as using the command. It also checks to make sure that a failed
  file read returns the correct message. Additionally, it checks to see that open file flags
  and pipe works.

  testscript.sh - used in makecheck

  README - this file, provides description of the files included.

  report.pdf - Contains benchmarks and analysis regarding the times of simpsh when compared to bash and dash.

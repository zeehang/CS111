LAB 1A README

Below, you will find descriptions of the files within this tar

  lab1.c - the source code for the project. I haven't found any limitations
  in the code - it correctly works with the functions --wronly, --rdonly, --command and --verbose
  giving error messages when the user input is not correct. It has been tested against the grading script
  as well as the test cases listed in the Makefile. At this stage, I'm not sure if it returns the maximum
  error number encountered over the course of running the program.

  Makefile - has the options to create the tar ball, clean up files created,
  as well as check test cases using testscript.sh. The cases include checking a normal
  rdonly and wronly, as well as using the command. It also checks to make sure that a failed
  file read returns the correct message.

  testscript.sh - used in makecheck

  README - this file, provides description of the files included.
